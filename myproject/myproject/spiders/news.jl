Tentatively known as M2, the processor has reportedly gone into production and could start shipping by July 2021.The chipsets will be produced by fab giant TSMC using its latest technology, known as 5-nanometer plus (N5P). Production of the chipsets will reportedly take at least three months. As before, the M2 would be a complete system-on-a-chip, with CPU, GPU and AI processors all integrated.\u00a0Apple now produces MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and, most recently, 24-inch iMac computers using M1 chipsets. However, the majority of models, including 21.5- and 27-inch iMacs, 13- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, the iMac Pro and the Mac Pro still run on Intel CPUs. Its original plan was to phase out Intel chipsets within two years, which would be around the end of 2022.\u00a0The next models rumored to arrive will be 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros \u2014 expected in Q2 or Q3 of 2021.

Thinner bezels surround a larger, 13.3-inch Full HD display on the 7320 Detachable, which has an 84 percent screen-to-body ratio. Dell claims the machine has a smaller, thinner footprint than previous models, while the display has 500 nits of brightness.Along with a fingerprint reader, the ExpressSign-in feature can detect your presence using an  IR camera and Windows Hello for touchless auto-wake and lock functions. The two-in-one features an outward-facing 8MP 1080p camera and a front-facing 5MP one with an Intel image processor.There are a pair of noise-canceling microphones, which Dell placed at the top to reduce typing noise. Dell suggests that the Intelligent Audio tech can filter out background noise, keep volume stable and give priority to \"preferred voices.\"You can pick up an optional active pen that rests in the nook between the new folio keyboard and the screen. Dell says that, when you place the pen there, it can fully recharge in 30 seconds. An ExpressCharge function can top up the 7320 Detachable's battery from zero to as much as 80 percent capacity in one hour, according to Dell. On the connectivity front, there's support for WiFi 6, 4G LTE and eSIM.As for the guts, the 7320 Detachable has an 11th-gen Intel processor (up to Core i7) with integrated Iris Xe graphics. You can have up to 32GB of LPDDR4 SDRAM. However, memory is soldered onto the board and is non-upgradable.On paper, the machine checks a lot of the right boxes for business users, so Dell could have a serious competitor to high-end Microsoft Surface devices on its hands.

It's following that investment up with a more physical display of its commitment to electrifying its lineup. In southeast Michigan, the company has established a battery development center called Ford Ion Park.The facility will house a centralized multidisciplinary team of 150 individuals who are experts in areas like research, manufacturing and purchasing. The company says the team will help it develop EV batteries that cost less and offer greater range. Ford has tapped Anand Sankaran, its current director of electrified systems engineering, to lead the Ion Park team. Sankaran's resume includes projects like the recent Mustang Mach-E and one of the automaker's first foray into EVs, the 2001 Escape Hybrid.\"Investing in more battery R&D ultimately will help us speed the process to deliver more, even better, lower-cost EVs for customers over time,\" said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford's chief product platform and operations officer. \"We are modernizing Ford's battery development and manufacturing capabilities so we can better control costs and production variables in-house and scale production around the world with speed and quality.\"Ford will also spend $185 million to establish a collaborative lab dedicated to developing, testing and building EV batteries. The 200,000 square foot facility, set to open late next year, will house equipment for piloting new manufacturing techniques that will allow the company to quickly scale new battery technologies. To show it's serious about these new initiatives, Ford's Battery Benchmarking and Test Laboratory will support them. The automaker opened the $100 million, 185,000 square foot facility last year to trial new battery chemistries. Since opening its doors, the facility has tested and analyzed more than 150 different types of cells.The two new facilities are a strong sign Ford has come to realize battery technology is critically important to a successful EV strategy. Tesla has stayed in front of the competition in no small part due to the range of its vehicles. And it looking to extend that lead with more affordable cells in next two to three years.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

{"title": "DoorDash offers restaurants more flexible commission rates | Engadget", "body": "Food delivery apps have long been criticized for the typically high commission rates they charge restaurants. In an industry where the profit margin is said to be around three to five percent on average, paying commission of up to 30 percent can be brutal.The exact commission rates these apps charge haven't always been entirely clear. However, DoorDash has taken a step toward greater transparency. The company has introduced a tiered commissions system for local restaurants in the US for both DoorDash and Caviar.Under the DoorDash Basic plan, restaurants will pay 15 percent commission and move a higher proportion of the delivery cost to customers. Their delivery area will be smaller than that of restaurants on higher-tier plans to \"ensure that Dashers continue to make meaningful earnings.\" Restaurant owners can still take part in marketing programs to promote their business.DoorDash Plus offers a larger delivery area and participation in the company's DashPass subscription service. Restaurants enrolled in the latter get a visibility boost in the app and customers are charged lower fees. DoorDash claims that, because DashPass subscribers place more orders, restaurants \"see increased growth.\" Restaurants on this plan will fork over a 25 percent commission.The top-tier plan is DoorDash Premier, which charges 30 percent commission. DoorDash says, along with DashPass benefits, this offers the widest delivery area and lowest customer delivery fees. If a restaurant on this plan accepts fewer than 20 orders for delivery, pickup and Caviar in a month (without canceling too many), DoorDash will refund commission on those.Elsewhere, the company says it's reducing commission for pickup orders to six percent. It's also killing off all fees for the Storefront ordering platform for all restaurants, save for payment processing fees.In December, the company gave restaurants the option to handle their own deliveries, including setting delivery fees and a custom service area. It promised a lower commission rate for those who opt for self-delivery.When many restaurants had to close their doors to dine-in customers at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, DoorDash temporarily reduced or waived its commissions. That helped out restaurants at an especially difficult time. The tiered plans and reduced commission for pickup orders could come as welcome news for them as well.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Creators, Zuckerberg said, \u201cshould be able to get a cut of the sales of things that they're recommending and we should build up an affiliate recommendation marketplace to enable that to all happen.\u201dFinally, Instagram is working on a \u201cbranded content marketplace\u201d that would help match influencers with sponsors. Zuckerberg noted that such a tool could help enable up and coming talent to monetize and help create a kind of \u201ccreator middle class.\u201d He didn\u2019t disclose how these deals might be structured but said the plan is to offer \u201cvery favorable terms\u201d to creators. \u201cWe're not building this from the perspective of us trying to make a lot of money.\u201dThe new tools are still in the works, but could dramatically shift the way influencers monetize their following on the platform. Many of Instagram's top stars already run online shops and form partnerships with brands. But for now, those deals largely happen off-platform so it can be difficult for less well-known personalities to make money. Bringing these kinds of tools into Instagram could make it easier to land deals.

(In case you were curious, Wall Street types were expecting revenue growth of just around 25 percent.) The company\u2019s net income jumped dramatically as well, from $6.8 billion in Q1 2020 to $17.9 billion in this year\u2019s quarter.\u00a0Such big lifts shouldn\u2019t come as much surprise \u2014 after all, we spent much of the year-ago quarter in the early phases of a pandemic that prompted some businesses to dramatically slash their advertising budgets. Those marketing dollars are what keep Google in the green, and with fewer of them to work with, Alphabet spent the last year posting muted financials compared to the rest of its FAANG cohorts. Still, Alphabet\u2019s latest release is yet another sign that the industry is slowly returning to business as usual \u2014 or something like it, anyway.\u201cOver the last year, people have turned to Google Search and many online services to stay informed, connected and entertained,\u201d Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued our focus on delivering trusted services to help people around the world.\u201dYouTube might be the best example of an Alphabet service that flourished during the pandemic; ads run on the platform accounted for $6 billion of Alphabet\u2019s total revenue pie. (That\u2019s up from about $4 billion just as people were staying to hunker down at home in earnest.) Alphabet also reported a new high for Google\u2019s Cloud business, which generated revenues of just over $4 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s \u201cOther Bets\u201d category \u2014 which includes businesses like autonomous driving company Waymo and Verily \u2014 held gained very slightly year-over-year. Those subsidiaries collectively pulled in about $60 million more than last year, but accompanying losses held more-or-less steady at about $1.1 billion.\u00a0Steady gains in Google\u2019s service revenue (which comes from the Play Store, Google One and more), along with heightened success in its broader ads business, means Alphabet is looking at a standout quarter. At time of publication, the holding company\u2019s share price is up about 4.2% in after-hours trading.While the world\u2019s gradual, vaccine-led reopening has clearly allowed more wind into Alphabet\u2019s sails, the company continues to face heightened scrutiny from regulators around the world for reportedly anti-competitive business practices.\u00a0Just last month, Google\u2019s attempt to block third-party tracking cookies in its Chrome web browser drew attention from the US Department of Justice, which pushed the search giant to explain how its planned shift could affect the news industry and its competitors in advertising. Most recently, Match Group chief legal officer Jared Sine accused Google of attempting to threaten his company by calling representatives on the phone seeking clarification on Sine\u2019s testimony to a Senate subcommittee.

Even more impressive, the company's profits jumped by 44 percent to reach $15.5 billion. Microsoft narrowly beat out Wall Street analyst expectations, who projected it would hit $41.05 billion in revenues during the quarter, according to Yahoo Finance.The reason for Microsoft's success isn't hard to figure out. Information workers are relying more on the company's cloud and digital services more than ever, a trend that won't slow down until they start returning to offices.

You could simulate locations from the past to help understand climate change, study urban sprawl or predict how a region will evolve by filling in blanks.However, there's little doubt the AI-created fakes could be used for misinformation. A hostile country could send falsified images to mislead military strategists \u2014 they might not notice a missing building or bridge that could be a valuable target. Fakes could also be used for political aims, such hiding evidence of atrocities or suppressing climate science.Researchers hope this work will help develop a system to catch satellite deepfakes in the same way that early work exists to spot human-oriented fakes. However, it might be a race against time \u2014 it didn't take long for early deepfake tech to escape from academia into the real world, and that might well happen again.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Nintendo is finally making interhet multiplayer useful, though. The gaming pioneer has released an update that gives Super Mario Party a much more robust online multiplayer experience. Up to four people can play the classic Mario Party board game or the team-based Partner Party, with 70 of the Switch title's 80 minigames available online instead of the paltry 10 from before.You can mix and match the number of online and local players. Two couples can duke it out using two consoles, for instance.The update is free, although you'll need a Switch Online membership to consider playing. While true online multiplayer is likely coming much later than people would like (where was this at the start of the pandemic?), it could extremely valuable at a time when it usually remains too risky to meet your friends for an in-person Mario Party session.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

{"title": "Samsung Galaxy S21 smartphones are up to $200 off at Amazon | Engadget", "body": "Samsung's latest smartphones are back on sale at Amazon right now. All three variants of the Galaxy S21 have been discounted again: the Galaxy S21 5G is down to $699, the Galaxy S21+ 5G is on sale for $799 and the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G is back down to $999. You'll save $200 at most depending on the model you choose and these are some of the best prices we've seen on the lineup. The only model that's been significantly cheaper recently is the S21 Ultra, which fell to $900 on Samsung's website for a limited time with the use of a coupon code.Buy Galaxy S21 5G at Amazon - $699 Buy Galaxy S21+ 5G at Amazon - $799 Buy Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G at Amazon - $999We consider the Galaxy S21 to be the best Android phone for the money, and that's with its standard $800 price tag. It earned a score of 88 from us for its attractive new design, lovely display, versatile cameras and long-lasting battery life. Samsung's new \"contour cut\" housing for the phone's rear cameras is much more attractive than that of previous hardware and the nearly edge-to-edge display provides an immersive experience. The S21 has a 6.2-inch, 2,400 x 1,080 resolution AMOLED panel while the S21+ has a 6.7-inch display with the same resolution. Running on Snapdragon 888 processor, these handsets have more than enough power to handle most things you'll throw at them \u2014 and in our testing, the S21 lasted around a day and a half before needing a recharge.As for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it's for those who don't want to compromise on anything. It has a 6.8-inch, 3,200 x 1,440 resolution AMOLED display, an even more capable rear camera setup that includes a 100x \"Space Zoom\" feature, a whopping 5,000mAh battery that can last up to two days on a single charge and S Pen compatibility (although you will have to buy that accessory separately). We also appreciate that Samsung addressed most issues in past year's premium model with the S21 Ultra, making it a good choice for power users. Since its exorbitant $1,200 price tag is one of the main things that should give potential buyers pause, Amazon's sale makes the S21 Ultra an easier buy.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice."}
{"title": "Two weeks with Spotify's Car Thing | Engadget", "body": "After years of rumors, confirmation and vague descriptions, Spotify has finally made its first piece of hardware available to select users. Even though the company revealed the full details on Car Thing earlier this month, it\u2019s only a \u201climited release\u201d right now. I\u2019ve spent two weeks with Car Thing in my car (obviously), and can tell you one thing \u2014 this dedicated Spotify player is really more of a controller for the app on your phone.Spotify first tipped its hand on an in-car music player in 2018. It offered a few Reddit users the opportunity to try a compact device that reportedly featured voice control and 4G connectivity. The company didn\u2019t comment at the time, and it\u2019s unclear if any units of this first circular device ever made it out into the wild.In 2019, reports indicated Spotify was ready to ship an in-car player. All the details from those rumblings turned out to be an accurate description of the Car Thing released this month. The Financial Times report mentioned voice control features, but added new info about preset buttons for playlists and Bluetooth connectivity. Around the same time, the company began adding Car View to its apps: a feature that switches to a simplified player interface when it detects your phone is connected to your vehicle over Bluetooth.A few months later in May 2019, the company officially revealed the name Car Thing along with renders of a device with an updated design. Spotify explained that testing for its first piece of hardware was underway, and on top of confirming previously reported specs, added that Car Thing would be powered by your vehicle\u2019s 12-volt outlet and would connect to your phone. The company was pretty much silent on the project until it popped up again in January. Car Thing made an appearance at the FCC with a very different design in early 2021. And while we didn\u2019t know it at the time, this would be the device that (some) users would finally get the opportunity to use.Car Thing is a device that\u2019s slightly smaller than an iPhone 11, in almost every dimension. It\u2019s a thin display with a sizable dial on the front. The dial serves as an alternative to navigating the touch screen, allowing you to scroll through menus by rotating it. Pressing the large round button shows tracks in an album, playlist or podcast. Just below the dial is a back button that takes you back to the Now Playing interface, returns to the Home screen or closes the audio player \u2014 depending on where you\u2019re starting.Four preset buttons line the top edge for quick access to playlists, albums and podcasts. These can be set with a press and hold or by asking the on-board voice assistant to do it for you. \u201cHey Spotify, save this to preset (1-4)\u201d does the trick. Ditto for playing one of the saved slots. You can either press the appropriate button or make the request with your voice. When you save a podcast, Car Thing will automatically play the most recent episode when you tap the preset button or ask for it to be played. Four microphones are positioned beside the preset buttons to hear those commands when the music is blasting or you have the windows rolled down. There's also a Settings button on the far right of the top that gives you access to a very limited menu. One handy tool it does offer is the ability to disable the microphones.\u00a0Around back, there\u2019s a single USB-C port for the power adapter. It\u2019s located in the middle of the device rather than along the edge like your phone, so I always needed to plug in the cable before attaching it to any of the mounts. It would be very difficult to try and do so if Car Thing was already in place on the dash.The Car Thing definitely reminds me of the XM Radio receiver I used in my \u201899 Pontiac Grand Am. That was long before the Sirius-XM merger. Back then, you used a radio frequency to connect the satellite radio receiver to your car and affixed a magnetic antenna somewhere on the outside. Just like Car Thing, these compact devices offered a way to get \u201cnew\u201d content streams without having to upgrade your stereo deck. Plus, the overall design and size is similar. Of course, what Spotify offers with voice control and a touchscreen is better-suited for 2021 than the physical buttons and monochrome displays of the early 2000s.There are a few steps to get Car Thing up and running, but the entire process takes less than five minutes. First, I had to select which mount to use. Spotify includes three options in the box for the dash, air vent and the CD slot. The choice will depend on your preference and the design of your car\u2019s interior. I went with the CD slot since it put Car Thing closer than the other two options, and situated it in clear view.As you can see from my images, this nearly blocks the small display in my 2006 Honda Element \u2014 most notably the clock. It also looks a bit cumbersome having a secondary device mounted in front of your built-in stereo. In the end, I decided easily glanceable and reachable was better than having to reach around the wheel to get to a vent or using adhesive to stick something on the dash.If you opt for a location that\u2019s near an air vent, Car Thing will alert you to potential interference. When the device detects air blowing near its microphones, both a spoken and visual prompt let me know that I might have trouble using voice features. The device will also recommend trying another location or a different mount. I didn\u2019t have any issues with Car Thing not hearing my commands \u2014 even if I had air blowing right at it.The next step is to plug Car Thing into a power source. For me, this meant the 12-volt outlet. From there, I navigated the Car section of the Settings menu in the Spotify app to proceed. The software will guide you through the process of connecting Car Thing to your phone via Bluetooth. This is an essential step since the player will always need to connect to your phone to get any data. Your phone is the brains behind everything Car Thing does, including providing connectivity.The setup asked if I was connecting to my car via Bluetooth or an aux cable. But even after chose one, I didn\u2019t have to change anything if I moved from a 2021 Honda Pilot, where my phone was connected via Bluetooth, to the older Element where aux cable is my only option. Once things are connected and in sync, the music can begin. From this point on, whenever I got in my car and connected my phone via Bluetooth or cable, Car Thing would automatically turn on and do its thing since if I left it plugged into the power source.When it comes to content, there\u2019s no setup aside from assigning the four preset buttons. Since Car Thing relies on your phone, everything from your Spotify account automatically shows up. Just like in the app, the Home screen displays recommendations based on recent activity. At the top of the screen, there are tabs for voice search (and recent search results) and Your Library.This main interface places emphasis on album and show artwork, giving you a side-scrolling collection of squares as your main navigation. Again, you can move through these and any other menu with either swipes or by rotating the physical dial. Each section of the Home screen only shows five items before moving to the next section. There\u2019s an option to show more before going to the next area, so you\u2019re not just stuck with a few of the most recent items.Spotify has offered voice search for a while inside of its apps, so it\u2019s no surprise that it's more robust voice control on Car Thing works well. The four microphones along top did a great job picking up my voice, and they did so with music playing as promised. I didn\u2019t encounter any issues with playing specific albums, songs, playlists or podcasts. I did however have some trouble with commonly mispronounced or weirdly spelled artists like Sunn O))), PVRIS and Bon Iver.Oddly, the Car Thing showed PVRIS as the spelling of what I asked for, but began playing a French song with \u201cParis\u201d in the title. As for Bon Iver, the voice assistant mistook my North Carolina accent as Boney Bear and played Boy & Bear the first five tries. Eventually, I got it. No issues at all with Gotye, HAIM or SBTRKT though. As is the case with other voice assistants, it helps to be specific, and some of my frustrations were because I was admittedly vague.I also had issues when multiple artists had the same name (Knives vs. NYVES) in addition to when the spelling and pronunciation varied. Perhaps it would help if Spotify could realize that I\u2019ve listened to the latter and never the former. In some instances like \u2020\u2020\u2020 (Crosses), the artist's name is in parenthesis, which probably helped with the voice search when the written moniker is just symbols. I don\u2019t think any of my annoyances were a hardware issue and are more likely to do with Spotify\u2019s voice assistant. And that technology can be easily updated to catch some of these more obscure pronunciations.Just like Car View, the player interface on Car Thing is simple. There\u2019s album/podcast artwork with the artist and title along with larger controls along the bottom for shuffle, skip, play/pause and save from left to right. Album and playlist menus are also basic, with emphasis on song and episode titles.I\u2019ll admit that I was ready to dismiss Car Thing at first blush. It seemed unnecessary, even in my Honda Element, when I already had my phone that works just fine as a music player \u2014 and it has its own virtual assistant. Heck, Spotify's own app has voice control. But once I began to use the device, I started to understand its purpose. While it seems only Spotify die-hards would be interested in something like this, it does offer an upgrade for older cars. I\u2019m never getting built-in voice control in the Element, and the ability to keep Waze on my phone and Spotify on another display definitely reduced the need to fiddle with either while driving. If you\u2019re OCD about cords and clutter, Car Thing will take some extra planning, but there are tidier solutions than what I\u2019ve been testing.The bigger question is if Spotify will even make this available to the masses. The company hasn\u2019t said exactly how many people will be included in this \u201climited release\u201d \u2014 an invite-only period where users can sign up for a chance to get a unit. Spotify did explain that you can expect to pay around $80 for one if it ever does go on sale, and that it would like to open up wider availability in the future. For now, Car Thing remains an \u201cexploration\u201d and an intriguing proposition as the company\u2019s first foray into making hardware.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

{"title": "\u2018The Falcon and Winter Soldier\u2019 fails to pay off on its initial promise | Engadget", "body": "This article contains general spoilers about the sixth episode of 'The Falcon and Winter Soldier.'The finale of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier had all the action and drama you\u2019d expect from the last act of a Marvel film. It also featured a lot of the place-setting that\u2019s become increasingly common as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has gotten bigger. Just as the end of Age of Ultron introduced us to \u201cnew\u201d Avengers like Scarlet Witch, Vision and Falcon, episode six of the Disney+ show had Sam claiming the mantle of Captain America and Bucky finally achieving some kind of emotional closure, among other plot developments.However, with very few exceptions, the majority of the episode was really just tying up plot threads introduced in the series itself. The Flag Smashers are gone, Zemo\u2019s back in jail and John Walker is no longer Captain America. If someone were to skip this series and move straight into the next Cap movie, they wouldn\u2019t have missed a beat; the last time they saw Sam Wilson, Steve had given him the shield and all it stands for, with Bucky happily supporting this choice. So what if Sam doubted his choice, passed on the shield, got Bucky super pissed off at him, and there was another dude filling the role for a while? The end of The Falcon and Winter Soldier put almost all of the characters back where they were at the end of Endgame, with a little more character development under the hood. Plot-wise not much has changed (with the exception of Sharon Carter).It has always been a curse of transmedia projects that you could never guarantee your audience has seen all the content. The first X-Files film came out in the gap between seasons five and six, but the new episodes couldn\u2019t really acknowledge much had happened in the intervening time as the film was still in theaters and not on home video, meaning there was a significant chunk of the audience who was still out in the cold. Star Trek films always came out after their respective series had ended; even though there were still two shows on the air after the end of The Next Generation, we didn\u2019t see any of the DS9 or Voyager characters in a TNG film until 2002\u2019s Nemesis. (The EMH appearing in First Contact doesn\u2019t count, nerds.)When the Marvel Cinematic Universe first started to emerge, it felt like we were promised something different. The movies would tie into each other, sure, and it was assumed people were going to see each and every one of them in order. It was only when the MCU made its way to television that it really got interesting as a transmedia project. Agents of SHIELD was going to show us what life was like day-to-day for ordinary SHIELD agents, fill in the gaps between films and flesh out the universe\u2026 but then it didn\u2019t. What we got was a fairly standard \u201cthreat of the week\u201d show with the occasional appearances of B-list film characters and, while the events of some of the movies trickled down into Agents of SHIELD from time to time (like the Hydra reveal), the show ultimately had no impact on the films. If you never watched Agents of SHIELD, Phil Coulson is still dead to you.With that precedent set, future Marvel shows didn\u2019t even bother with the pretense. Sure, all of the Marvel Netflix shows were set in the MCU and would occasionally reference things like the Battle of New York (from the first Avengers), but the heroes were still roped off in their own distinct corner where they only interacted with each other. Hulu series like Runaways, Cloak and Dagger and Helstrom also occupied their own standalone places. And, despite the fact that it made sense plot-wise to have all of the television characters appear in the big battle in Endgame, the Russos made the decision to leave them out as to not confuse the audience (though James D\u2019Arcy\u2019s Jarvis from Agent Carter made a brief cameo earlier in the film).The practice of keeping things standalone made a lot of sense when the various MCU shows were scattered between networks and services. But that\u2019s why the Disney+ announcement was so exciting: Not only could Marvel assure that every show and film would live in the same place, but the programs were no longer beholden to licensing restrictions that limited characters to one show or the movies only. The Marvel Disney+ shows were touted as bringing the movie heroes and their respective big budgets to the small screen.That\u2019s been true so far for WandaVision and The Falcon and Winter Soldier, which revolved around significant supporting players from the tentpole films. No, we weren\u2019t going to see Thor or the Hulk charging into battle, but characters that were previously second-fiddle got a lot of character development, stepping up into more prominent roles in the Marvel Universe. At least, it was supposed to be that way.If you look at the upcoming slate of Marvel films, they\u2019re all focused on heroes that have yet to make a TV appearance and probably never will: Black Widow, Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, Thor and Captain Marvel. The Scarlet Witch is supposed to make an appearance in the next Doctor Strange movie, but it still operates somewhat independently from WandaVision, with even star Elizabeth Olsen saying she was unaware of the film\u2019s plot while shooting the Disney+ show.While all the Marvel films and the new shows will share a home on Disney+ going forward, it seems they\u2019re still going to be segregated for the same reason that transmedia always has: You can\u2019t assume your audience has seen everything. One would hope that means the movies will become more standalone as well, since we\u2019re nearing 30 films in the franchise and it\u2019s a lot for a newcomer to take in. If they don\u2019t and the shows continue to be self-contained, the promise of a TV universe on par with its cinematic counterpart will remain unfulfilled."}
